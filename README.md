# BigNumber-calculator-
This C++ project allows any basic arithmetic calculations between two numbers that would be too large for a type of "int" or "long int"


This works by creating an object named "BigNumber" . The number that you want to write MUST be written like a string!
If you want to write the number inside of the console, you just need to go to line 725 and make the if condition "true". 

Available operators :
summation (+), negation (-), division (/), multiplication (*), modulus (%), greater (>), greater equals (>=), less than (<), less than equals (<=), equal (==), not equal(!=)

KNOWN ISSUE WITH MODULUS : IF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS GIVEN NEGATIVE AND LEFT IS POSITIVE, IT WILL GIVE THE ANSWER AS 0
